## Introduction

The David Rumsey Map Center has an extensive collection of maps that depict California as an island, instead of part of continental North America. Approximately 700 of these maps are available in the Glen McLaughlin collection, which can be seen in the digital exhibition <a href="https://exhibits.stanford.edu/california-as-an-island" target="_blank">California as an Island in Maps</a>. Alternatively, you can search the library's catalog <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/zb871zd0767" target="_blank">SearchWorks</a> to access the online collection.

## Learning Outcomes

This module aims to:

- Inform students about the collection of California as an Island maps. (Common Core Standard Identifier: CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RH.11-12.2)
- Encourage students to think critically about the accuracy of primary sources. (Common Core Standard Identifier: CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RH.11-12.8)
- Prompt students to ask questions about what purpose maps have been created for, such as who commissioned or drew them and why, and think about the cultural context in which they emerged. (Common Core Standard Identifier: CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RH.11-12.6)
- Engage in intersectional forms of inquiry by combining their knowledge from different disciplines, considering others' interpretations of material, and bringing their own independent perspectives into group discussions. (Common Core Standard Identifier: CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RH.11-12.9)
- Increase students' confidence in using primary sources for academic purposes (Common Core Curriculum Standard Identifier: CCSS.ELA-Literacy.RH.11-12.7).

## Introduction to California as an Island

California depicted as an island on maps might be one of the most prolific and persistent mistakes in the history of map making. The Glen McLaughlin Collection of California as an Island includes over 700 maps displaying this anomaly over a time period of over 200 years! But where did this misconception come from, why did it persist for so long, and how was it finally rectified? The answers involve a popular contemporary novel about a mythical island, a Spanish friar with a political agenda, copycat cartographers dealing with little-known corners of the world, and, of course, pirates!

## Class Structure

The class is structured to combine a range of activities, group discussions, and lecture-style content. Each of the following activities are designed to teach students the lecture content in an engaging way, while also developing their abilities to think critically about primary sources.

## Preparing Materials

## Lesson Plan

#### Step 1. Brief Introduction

When starting this module on California as an Island, give students a quick overview of what the topic is about.

**Aim:** Here, the aim is to pique students' interest in the topic by telling them that for about 200 years, maps from around the world depicted California as an Island where it had previously been included as part of continental North America.

**Activity:** Give students a brief description of the Glen McLaughlin collection of over 700 of these maps, and ask the class why they think this way of viewing California became popularised. Conclude this section by telling students that the story of this collection involves the story of a mythical island, a Spanish friar with a political agenda, copy-cats, and pirates!

#### Step 2. Group Activity: Ordering Maps

Before delving into the story of California as an Island, break students into groups of 2-4 for a group activity.

**Aim:** The aim of this activity is to get students thinking critically about the material and make them comfortable to share their opinions with classmates. Smaller groups work best for this as each student has the opportunity to give their input.

**Activity:** Give each group of students a copy of the print-out maps (number 1 under 'Preparing Materials') which have been pre-cut into six distinct maps. Ask students to take 3 minutes to organise them in the order in which they think they were drawn or produced. Finally, show students the order in which they were produced, and explain that you will now tell them the interesting story behind this pattern.

[***Option 1:*** If your lesson is longer than 1 hour, you can then go between each group and ask them why they put them in the order they chose.]

[***Option 2:*** To spend more time on this activity, you can ask two groups of students to join each other, compare their ordering, and discuss any different choices they made.]

#### Step 3. Lecture Content

Tell students the story of how California began to be depicted as an island, and how this was eventually corrected through Kino's scientific inquiry and King Ferdinand VI's formal declaration.

**Aim:** To inform students about the collection of California as an Island maps.

**Activity:** Download the lecture slides (number 2 under 'Preparing Materials') and follow the speaker notes. Don't feel bound by this activity - feel free to create your own presentation, adapt the slide deck, or present the story in a way you feel will be most engaging to your students. The sky is the limit!

#### Step 4. Group Activity: Inductive Inquiry [Optional]

Prompt students to search for primary source material.

**Aim:** The aim of this activity is to increase students' comfort with using primary source materials. Specifically, it seeks to encourage students to identify potential research materials and improve their confidence in naming unusual or interesting representations and perspectives in source materials.

**Activity:** Break students into small groups (3-5 students), ideally with the same group members from Step 2. Using a timer, give students 3 minutes to work alone and find a map in the California as an Island collection that catches their attention, looking for interesting or unexpected things on maps. If your class is in the David Rumsey Map Center, students may choose to wander around the room and identify interesting materials in-person. After 3 minutes, ask them to come back to their group to share what they have found and why it interested them.

[***Note:*** This activity is optional, and is designed to be easily removed from the lesson plan.]

#### Step 5. Group Activity: Deductive Inquiry

Ask students to critically analyse pre-selected maps in the collection.

**Aim:** To encourage students to critically engage with primary source material.

**Activity:** Ask students to stand up, move around the room, and look at the wider collection of maps. This requires the instructor to print out the copies of maps and topic cards (numbers 3 and 4 in the 'Preparing Materials' section) and place these maps around the room in advance of the activity. Allow students to self-select groups of about 4-5 students, ideally different groups to the prior activities. Ask each group to pick a topic card ('Preparing Materials' number 3) and discuss the prompts. After giving students time to wander between the maps (recommend 10 minutes, but this will vary depending on the length of the lesson), choose a map you believe has had a lot of engagement and open a class-wide discussion, led by the prompts. This gives space for students to engage in ways they are comfortable with - allowing quieter students space to contribute to smaller discussions, and encouraging those who are comfortable to contribute to the class-wide discussion.

**_Note:_** If the class is held in the David Rumsey Map Center, these materials will be prepared by the center in advance of the class. The DRMC will provide the original maps for students to examine in-person at the center where possible.

#### Step 6. Conclusion

Reinforce the idea that stories and historical context can be identified by critically examining visual data such as maps.

**Aim:** Encourage students to use primary sources in future research.
